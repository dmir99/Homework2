# Homework2
All different versions of files are titled accordingly

partA = the first task of taking a user input and converting it in to the right format

partB = the second task of taking the txt file and pulling from that to get the dates

partC = the last and final task of taking from the txt file and writing to a new txt file

Please forgive me if you did not want it in 3 files, I am new to GitHub and learning my way around.
